# VBA_COM
Created a terminal like RealTerm using CLRS232 COMmod for use in 32-bit and 64-bit computers and have used and tested on Windows 10 and the lastet Excel 365 application. CLRS232 is a class module where as the VBA_COM is just a module. Found many examples out there just to read and parse the data stream. But this one is more for controllers that want to talk to and get an immediate response back. Each sub rotuine was a button and the rest should be self explanitory on how where to put the values for the baud rate and such, in column "P".
